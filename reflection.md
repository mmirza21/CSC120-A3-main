- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think that Java is a much more complex language than python as the syntax is a lot more complex and there are some things that you cpould do quite easy in python that you need for loops for in java, like splicing a list.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Java is object-oriented while python is not, meaning that everything needs a class and we need to create objects and instances of that to use any functions, while python could directly access variables and classes.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
A for loop was not working so I had to use a while loop. I would advise others to start early on their assignments.
